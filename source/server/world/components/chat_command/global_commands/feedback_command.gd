extends ChatCommand
## Lets any player send a bug report or suggestion straight from chat, without
## leaving the game. The message is logged server-side (tagged [FEEDBACK] for an
## easy grep) and, if a Discord webhook is configured, posted there too — so the
## alpha's reports collect in one inbox. Rate-limited to curb spam/flooding.
##
## Context is auto-attached (who/where/version) so a report is actionable even
## when the player only types "the flag is broken".


## Longer messages are truncated (Discord-friendly + anti-abuse).
const MAX_LEN: int = 500
## Anti-flood: at most MAX_PER_WINDOW well-formed reports per WINDOW_MS, per peer.
const MAX_PER_WINDOW: int = 3
const WINDOW_MS: int = 60_000
## Shown in the reply so players know where to send screenshots/clips (chat can't
## carry attachments). Hardcoded on purpose — no config lookup.
