## In-game help / onboarding reference. Static content, no server calls. Opened from the Help tile in the
## menu overlay, and pointed to by the first-run welcome modal. Edit HELP_TEXT to change the copy.


const HELP_TEXT: String = """[b]The short version[/b]
A hard, sandbox MMORPG. No forced path and no hand-holding. Explore, fight, build a guild, take territory. Finding your own footing is the point.

[b]Where to start[/b]
Talk to NPCs. The Hall Keeper near your starting cell has a first quest. NPCs offering quests are the main thread to pull when you want a direction.

[b]Guilds and territory[/b]
Join or found a guild, then take a territory by capturing its banner, and earn Glory for as long as your guild holds it. See the Guild and Leaderboard menus.

[b]Community and feedback[/b]
This is an alpha, so expect rough edges, and patch notes land in your Mailbox.
Type /players in chat to see who is online. Found a bug or have an idea? Type /feedback to send it straight to us.
