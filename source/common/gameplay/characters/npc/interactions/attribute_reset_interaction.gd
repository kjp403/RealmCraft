class_name AttributeResetInteraction
extends NPCInteraction
## NPC capability: re-spec — refunds all spent attribute points for a gold fee so
## the player can rebuild a different way. Opens a confirm dialog; the reset itself
## is the server-authoritative attribute.reset handler, which reads COST here so
## the displayed price and the charged price can't drift.

## Gold fee for a respec. Single source of truth — the server handler reads it too.
const COST: int = 25000
