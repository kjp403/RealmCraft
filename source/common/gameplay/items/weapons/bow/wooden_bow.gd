extends Weapon
## Bow VISUALS only — draw frames + charge/idle animation states. All gameplay
## (charge timing, damage ratios, projectile speed, multishot, mana cost) lives
## in the ChargeAbility .tres files on the scene's abilities array:
##   abilities[0] = primary charged shot, abilities[1] = multishot.
## Input, charge state, cooldowns and firing are the base Weapon + ChargeAbility
## pipeline — this script just reacts to "is my ability charging?" after each
## action to keep the bow's sprite honest.

## The bow's 3 charge frames — a LAYOUT CONVENTION shared by every bow sheet
## (bone/wood/rustic/fire all place them at these coordinates), so apply_skin
## swaps the texture and these regions stay valid for any skin. Frame 0 =
## relaxed bow at rest, frame 1 = half-draw, frame 2 = full draw. All 16x32.
const BOW_CHARGE_FRAMES: Array[Rect2] = [

]

## Active tween driving the WeaponSprite region swap. Killed on each new phase
## so charge → release → re-charge doesn't leave a stale frame.

## Ascension bow icons share the atlas sheet's convention, NOT the melee one:
## string on the near side, limbs bulging toward the shot. The sheet draws that
## axis flat (string left / limbs right), the icons draw it on the NE diagonal —
## so the icons need a 45 degree turn to line the limbs up with the aim, and must
## NOT be mirrored (flip_h swaps string and limbs, which is the bow held
## backwards). Riser is near the texture center, so centered is correct — do
## not use the melee tip-up pull (that slides the bow off the hand).
