class_name Projectile
extends Area2D
## Base for EVERY fired projectile (arrows, wand bolts, heal bolts, and any future one). It owns the
## whole hit pipeline in ONE place: move, detect, and react. Detection is a per-frame SHAPE QUERY
## (the same mechanism melee uses) rather than area/body_entered — enter-events only fire on a
## boundary crossing, so they miss a target the projectile spawns INSIDE (point-blank / packed mobs)
## or blows past in a single frame. The query catches them all, at any speed.
##
## Subclasses customise ONLY the per-hit response by overriding [method _resolve_hit]; they never
## re-implement detection, walls, piercing, or the Arcane-Wall pass-through. See HealBolt.

## Seconds a projectile flies before despawning if it hits nothing (speed × this ≈ max range).

## Max distance moved between hit checks. A fast projectile (or a frame-time spike under load) moves
## speed×frametime per frame; if that exceeds the hit shape, a point-blank target can fall BETWEEN two
## static overlap checks and get skipped. Sub-stepping the move to ≤ this (half the 16px hit shape)
## makes detection continuous — speed- and framerate-independent. 1 step at normal speed, so ~free.

## Colliders already handled this flight (instance_id) — so a piercing shot hits each target once
## and a lingering overlap isn't re-resolved every frame.

## Set on a non-pierce DAMAGED hit so the same physics step can't cleave a second
## packed mob before queue_free() takes effect (is_instance_valid stays true until idle).
