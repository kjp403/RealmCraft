extends Weapon
## War Hammer: the base Weapon plus a punchy, code-driven slam (wind-up →
## anticipation hold → violent snap → recoil) on the weapon, plus an on-impact
## ground shockwave (SlamImpact) + debris + screen shake. All the JUICE scales
## PER ABILITY — the basic tap is modest, Earthshatter is a screen-shaking,
## rock-spitting showpiece — by reading the performed AbilityResource's
## impact_shake / impact_reach / impact_particles. Code-driven because juice is
## procedural; a keyframed body animation can layer on top later.

## Slam timing — slow wind-up, a beat of anticipation, then a FAST smash, so it
## reads as heavy. Smash drives PAST 90° so the head clearly hits the ground.
const RAISE_S: float = 0.14   ## raise the hammer high overhead
const HOLD_S: float = 0.05    ## hang at the top (anticipation)
const SMASH_S: float = 0.22   ## the DESCENT — long enough for the eye to track
const GROUND_HOLD_S: float = 0.1  ## stay planted in the crater (weight) before lifting
const SETTLE_S: float = 0.26  ## recoil back to rest, overshooting
const RAISE_ANGLE: float = -120.0
const SMASH_ANGLE: float = 95.0   ## past vertical — reads as a ground slam
const SMASH_SCALE: float = 1.6    ## peak head size at the moment of contact

## The slam's hitbox is a CENTERED circle on the wielder, so the ring is drawn
## centered too — it now MATCHES the damage zone (no forward offset). The head
## still visually comes down via the rotation tween; the shockwave radiates from
## your feet, which is honest for a centered AoE.
