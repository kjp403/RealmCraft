class_name CombatHit
## The single place every melee / projectile hitbox routes a hit through, so the
## target rules (flags, PvP zones, sparring, guild friendly-fire) and the shared
## collision mask live in ONE spot. Adding a new weapon means "spawn an Area2D
## with TARGET_MASK and call try_damage" — it can't forget the flag path or the
## friendly-fire gate the way each hitbox used to re-implement them.

## Collision mask every combat hitbox uses (Area2D.collision_mask): hurtboxes (damage) +
## territory flags (capture) + world (block). NOT character bodies — those are navigation
## only, so attacks hit the body-sized HurtBox instead. See PhysicsLayers + docs/combat_layers.md.
## Projectiles read this; melee arcs set their mask from PhysicsLayers in their own _ready.
const TARGET_MASK: int = PhysicsLayers.COMBAT_TARGET_MASK

## Damage types. Physical is mitigated by ARMOR, magic by MR — pass the right
## one to try_damage (melee/arrows default to physical; wand bolts send magic).
const DAMAGE_PHYSICAL: StringName = &"physical"
const DAMAGE_MAGIC: StringName = &"magic"

}


## Resolve a hit on [param body] from [param source] for [param damage]. Applies
## the damage when valid and returns how the caller should react: a projectile
## queue_frees on DAMAGED/BLOCKED and passes through on IGNORED; a melee arc just
## ignores the result and lets the damage land. Server-authoritative — call only
## where damage is owned (the hitboxes already gate on multiplayer.is_server()).

## The single melee-detection path. Server-only. Runs a deterministic physics
## shape query against [param hitbox]'s "CollisionShape2D" child and returns the
## bodies currently inside it. Every melee weapon (sword, pickaxe, sickle, …)
## routes through this, so they all hit the same things — STILL targets included
## (a territory flag, a motionless mob), which an Area2D's enter-events and
## get_overlapping_bodies() miss for a hitbox spawned on top of them. Must be
## called from _physics_process (direct_space_state is only valid during physics).
##
## [param max_results] caps the query. It has to comfortably clear the busiest
## realistic overlap — a wide AoE (whirlwind, meteor) over a packed mob camp
## sees one result PER collider, and anything past the cap is silently dropped,
## which reads in-game as "the ability didn't hit that one".

## THE single allegiance check: are these two players ALLIES? Resolved by context,
## highest priority first — a live spar match (teammates only; opponents are NOT

## so the rule can never drift apart.
