class_name AttackTelegraph
extends CanvasGroup
## A brief red danger-zone preview. Two shapes:
##  - CIRCLE (default): an enemy's melee range when it swings.
##  - CORRIDOR: set [member line_to] — a capsule from this node's position to
##    the dash landing point (the lunge path), so players see WHO is charging
##    and exactly which strip of ground to vacate.
## Purely a client visual (spawned via the container's rp_ ops) — never affects
## gameplay.
##
## CanvasGroup on purpose (owner call 2026-07-09): the corridor is THREE
## overlapping primitives (rect + two end caps). Drawn translucent directly,
## the overlaps double-blend into visible seams; the group flattens the
## opaque shapes into one buffer first and the alpha applies ONCE, uniformly.

## Opaque — transparency is applied at the GROUP level via self_modulate.

## Fill colour. Defaults to the danger red every melee/lunge preview uses; a boss
## beam overrides it so its corridor matches the element it is about to fire.

## Lifetime of the fade. Default suits a quick melee swing flash; longer-lived
## telegraphs (the lunge's dodge zone) set it to windup + travel time.
var duration: float = 0.35
## Non-zero = corridor mode: a capsule from local origin to this point, with
## [member radius] as its half-width.
