class_name PickSwingAbility
extends AbilityResource
## Pickaxe / tool swing. Spawns a PickArc that:
##   - Damages Character bodies a little (pickaxe-as-weapon: weak by design).
##   - Triggers MineableNode.register_pickaxe_hit on overlap (the actual harvest).
##
## Higher-tier pickaxes use the same ability with a tuned extraction_damage
## to chip ore HP faster — that's the "tool tier matters" progression.


@export var arc_scene: PackedScene = preload("res://source/common/gameplay/combat/pick_arc.tscn")
## Damage when this swing accidentally clips a Player or NPC. Kept low —
## you don't want a wooden pickaxe to be a real combat weapon.
@export var character_damage: float = 2.0
## Extraction damage applied to MineableNodes per swing. 1 = wooden, scale
## up for higher tiers. Combined with node.extraction_hp this sets the
## "swings per ore yield" feel.

## The tool this swing counts as. Veins want &"pickaxe", herbs want &"sickle".
## Forwarded to the PickArc so MineableNode.required_tool can gate the gather.
