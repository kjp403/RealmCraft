class_name BlinkAbility
extends AbilityResource
## A short teleport in the caster's aim direction (rank-scaled distance), raycast-clamped
## so you can't blink INTO a wall. The book's dive/escape tool (Inspiration). No i-frames
## — the teleport itself is the dodge.
##
## Client-side: movement is client-authoritative, so the local player teleports ITSELF the
## instant the button is pressed (predict_use, which runs only on the caster's client),
## and the regular position sync shows the jump to everyone. use_ability stays a no-op —
## the server just runs cooldown + mana like any other ability. No new exploit surface: a
## position-hacker could already move anywhere; the raycast is purely "don't land in geo".


## Teleport distance in pixels (ranks raise it).
@export var distance: float = 140.0
## Stop this far short of a wall the ray hits (so you don't clip the surface).
@export var wall_margin: float = 8.0
