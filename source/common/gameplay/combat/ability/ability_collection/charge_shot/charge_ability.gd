class_name ChargeAbility
extends AbilityResource
## Generic hold-to-charge projectile ability: press starts the charge, release
## fires — damage and projectile speed scale with how long the button was held.
## The bow's primary shot AND its multishot are both just .tres instances of
## this (multishot = projectile_count 3 + a mana cost); a future crossbow or
## fireball staff is data, not a new weapon script.
##
## Server-authoritative: the SERVER's instance of this resource tracks
## charge_start, so held-time (and therefore damage) is computed server-side —
## a client can't lie about its charge. Clients run the same code for visuals.
##
## Cooldown stamps on RELEASE (via the weapon), mana likewise.

## single-target burst nuke).
