class_name ShotOverrideAbility
extends AbilityResource
## The bow's SHOT OVERRIDE: pressing this ability fires nothing — it ARMS your next
## charged draw (Multishot fans it, Deadeye makes it a piercing sniper round, Frozen
## Arrow turns it into the ice ultimate). One verb (the draw), many adjectives.
##
## Born from a live abuse: when every bow ability was its own instant attack, testers
## fired the basic + an ability back-to-back for two full attacks a second. An override
## can't add an attack by construction — it only re-flavors the one you were drawing.
## Bonus: the armed shot still scales with DRAW time, so a panic-tap Multishot is weak
## and a full-draw one is the real volley.
##
## Rules: one override armed at a time — arming while already armed is REFUSED (see
## can_use below), the loaded shot is a commitment, not a swap. Cooldown + mana stamp
## on the RELEASE that actually fires it (Weapon.stamp_armed_override), not on the
## arming press — an unfired arm costs nothing but its EXPIRY_S grace before it
## fizzles. Armed state lives in Character.armed_shot, set identically on every peer
## by the action echo; the consume happens in ChargeAbility.release_ability on every
## peer too — deterministic, no sync.

## Arming while ALREADY armed is refused — the loaded shot is a commitment (owner rule:
## while armed, no other abilities either; that half lives in the weapon/server gates).
## Cooldown + mana are charged when the SHOT FIRES (the consume in ChargeAbility), not
## here — arming is intent, the draw is the cast.
