class_name HealingAuraAbility
extends ChannelAbility
## A rooted healing channel: every tick, restore [member heal_per_tick] HP to the
## caster AND to nearby players within [member radius]. Slow but steady — the
## tank-cleric's sustain. You're planted while it runs (moving cancels it), which
## is the counterplay. Tiers grow the heal + radius as an upgrade chain in the
## hammer Inspiration branch.
##
## Server-authoritative; the green aura renders from the channel push and each
## heal pops a green number via the existing combat.hit heal feedback.

## HP restored per tick to each valid target (caster + nearby players).
@export var heal_per_tick: float = 3.0


## Lead with the heal-per-second, then the channel/mana lines from ChannelAbility.
