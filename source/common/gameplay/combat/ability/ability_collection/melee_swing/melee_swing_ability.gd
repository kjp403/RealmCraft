class_name MeleeSwingAbility
extends AbilityResource
## Generic "swing a melee weapon" ability. Owns the hitbox spawn, damage
## resolution, and animation hook. The ability lives in combat/ — any
## melee weapon (sword, axe, dagger, future hammer) references it from its
## item.tres without re-implementing the swing.
##
## Per-weapon tuning happens via the @export fields below: a heavy axe might
## bump base_damage and spawn_offset; a dagger might shrink both.


## Spawned in front of [param user] when the swing fires.
@export var arc_scene: PackedScene = preload("res://source/common/gameplay/combat/melee_arc.tscn")
## Damage as a fraction of the wielder's AD (LoL-style). 1.0 = a swing deals
## 100% of your AD; a heavy slow weapon might go 1.3, a fast dagger 0.7. AD comes
## from base + the Strength attribute + gear (incl. the weapon's own AD bonus),
## so a stronger character / better weapon scales every swing.
@export var ad_ratio: float = 1.0
## How far forward (along [param direction]) the hitbox spawns from the
## character's origin. The CollisionShape inside the arc scene already has
## its own forward offset + radius — this just biases the whole spawn so
## tuning reach is one number instead of two. Keep small (0–8) for most
## weapons; bump higher for polearms / spears.
@export var spawn_offset: float = 0.0
## Animation to play when the swing fires. Library prefix included
## (e.g. "weapon/sword.swing"). The weapon scene loads the library on equip.
@export var swing_animation: StringName

## On-hit slow (Crippling Strike): flat move_speed cut + duration, handed to the
## arc so each struck Player gets a timed negative buff. 0 = no slow.
@export var slow_amount: float = 0.0
@export var slow_duration_s: float = 0.0

## Cap how many combatants one swing can damage (0 = unlimited AoE). Basics
## set this to 1 so a swing doesn't cleave / pull a whole pack at once.
@export var max_targets: int = 0

## Overrides the arc scene's hitbox radius (0 = keep the scene default). Lets a
## "devastating" T3 swing actually hit a bigger area than the basic swing while
## reusing the same arc scene — pair it with a matching [member impact_reach].
@export var arc_radius: float = 0.0

## A one-shot impact VFX (an animated spritesheet, e.g. a hammer crashing down from
## the sky) shown centred on the wielder when this swing fires — for the dramatic
## TELEGRAPHED slams, where the wind-up gives it time to fall. The hammer weapon
## spawns it timed to the smash (see hammer.gd). Null = just the code SlamImpact.
@export var impact_vfx: SpriteFrames
@export var impact_vfx_scale: float = 1.3
## Which frame of [member impact_vfx] is the moment it hits the ground (1-indexed,
## NOT from 0). The weapon delays the VFX so THIS frame lands on the smash (the
## hammer falls in the last stretch of the wind-up, after the telegraph). For the
## sky-hammer sheet the ground-hit frame is 5.
@export var impact_vfx_frame: int = 5


## Damage (as % of AD), plus on-hit slow and wind-up when this swing has them —
## so each tier's real numbers show in the mastery detail panel.
