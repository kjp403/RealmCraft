## Base of every weapon action. There is deliberately NO "basic attack vs
## ability" split — a basic attack is just an ability with mana_cost 0. That
## one rule keeps the whole layer uniform: ABILITY_HASTE shortens every
## cooldown (it IS attack speed for basics and cooldown reduction for
## specials), and mana only gates the actions that declare a cost.

## its synced mana; server is authoritative) and consumed server-side by the
## weapon right after use.

## During the cast a danger telegraph fills, the wielder is rooted (set root_s
