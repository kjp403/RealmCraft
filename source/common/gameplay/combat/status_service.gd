class_name StatusService
## Pushes a player their own status snapshot (timed buffs, damage-over-time
## debuffs, in-combat flag) for the HUD status strip. Server-side only, called
## once per second from the instance StatusTick — 1 Hz is plenty for icons
## that only ever show whole-second countdowns.
##
## Durations cross the wire as REMAINING SECONDS, never absolute timestamps:
## client and server run separate clocks (Time.get_ticks_msec is per-process),
## so an expires_ms would be meaningless on the other side.
