## A weapon category's full mastery tree. Branch grouping lives on the nodes
## themselves (MasteryNode.branch). One .tres per category in
## res://source/common/gameplay/mastery/trees/ — MasteryService discovers them
## by folder and keys them by [member category].

## Sum of every node's cost — design target: equals the points available at
## mastery cap, so a capped player can own the whole tree.
