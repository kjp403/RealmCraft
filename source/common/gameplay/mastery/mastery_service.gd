class_name MasteryService
## Weapon mastery rules: tree discovery, point math, spend/respec/loadout
## validation, and applying the results to a live player (special-slot
## mounting + passive stat modifiers). Static-only, like BasingService.
##
## XP accrual itself lives on PlayerResource.add_mastery_xp (mirrors job
## skills); the kill hook is in HostileNpc._reward_killer. Full design:
## docs/mastery.md.
