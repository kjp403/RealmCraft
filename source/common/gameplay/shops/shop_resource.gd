class_name ShopResource
extends Resource
## Editor-authored shop definition. Attach one to an NPC's ShopInteraction —
## either inline (a sub-resource on the NPC) or a shared .tres dragged into the
## interaction's `shop` field. The server resolves the shop from the merchant
## NPC's giver_key() (its NPCResource filename slug) via Map.shops, the same way
## quests resolve their giver; the client renders the catalog from the resource
## carried in the menu arg, so no registry id, Generate step, or index is needed.

@export var shop_name: String
## Default currency the whole shop trades in (e.g. event tokens for a fair
## stall). Leave empty for gold. A per-entry [member ShopEntry.currency_item]
## overrides this for that one item.

## What this vendor TAKES from the player — barter bundles OR gold buy-backs
## ("give 1 Bone Sword, receive 4 gold" is just a trade whose payout is gold).
## Specialty rates; items listed here prefer this over flat [member Item.vendor_value].
@export var accepted_trades: Array[ShopTrade]
## When true, the Sell tab also lists any owned item with [member Item.vendor_value] > 0
## (gatherable junk-sell). Specialty [member accepted_trades] still take priority for
## matching item ids. Default on so general merchants accept materials.
