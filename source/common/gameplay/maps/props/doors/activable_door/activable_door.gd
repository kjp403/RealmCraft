class_name ActivableDoor
extends StaticBody2D
## A door / gate. OPEN = collision off (pass through); CLOSED = collision on
## (blocks players). It's a plain node — RoomNode drives it: on the server it
## decides, and a dungeon.room push tells every client which doors to toggle (see
## RoomNode), so no prop baking / ids are needed. Uses the closing/opening anims.
##
## For a room seal, set starts_open = true: the party walks in, the room closes it
## behind them, and clearing the room opens it onward. (open_door() is kept as the
## bare "open" call the ground_button demo uses.)

## Start open (collision off) instead of the default closed gate.

## Open (pass) or close (block). [param animate] false snaps without playing the
## transition (used on spawn). Collision is toggled deferred — safe to call mid-
