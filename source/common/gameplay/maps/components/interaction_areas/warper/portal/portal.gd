extends Warper
## A Warper dressed as an animated portal: the swirl sprite + a full HSV recolor + an
## optional destination label + a dwell-then-fade warp transition. All warp behavior is
## inherited — the server only honors [member Warper.warp_delay_s] before firing, so
## doors (delay 0) stay instant. Place it in a map exactly like a plain Warper (set
## target_instance / warper_id / target_id), then pick a color per destination.
## @tool so color + label preview live in the editor while placing.

## Dominant HSV of the source swirl art (weighted by s*v over opaque pixels — measured,
## don't eyeball). portal_color is matched against these: hue ROTATES to the target's
## hue, saturation and value SCALE by target/source. Scaling keeps the art's internal
## shading (bright core, dimmer rim), so a dark pick gives a genuinely dark portal
## instead of the hue-only bright-cyan miss the first iteration had.
