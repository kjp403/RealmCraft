class_name ClickableArea
extends Area2D
## A reusable world-space CLICK TARGET: emits [signal clicked] on a left-click or tap,
## and [signal right_clicked] for desktop context actions.
## It carries NO policy — each user decides what the click MEANS (talk, inspect, loot,
## open) by connecting [signal clicked]. So players, NPCs, signs, lootables, doors all
## share one detection path instead of re-implementing the input-event boilerplate.
##
## Pair it with a CollisionShape2D child and tune that box (in the editor, or in code).
## It is [member input_pickable] so the mouse/touch can hit it — which has a per-area
## cost, so add it ONLY to things worth clicking, never to a shared base that enemies
## would inherit.

## Emitted once per left-click / tap that lands on this area.
