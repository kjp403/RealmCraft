class_name DailyQuestTemplate
extends Resource
## One generative blueprint for a daily quest. The board rolls 3 of these per
## player per day, scoped to their level range.
##
## Kinds: KILL / COLLECT are targeted (match enemy_type / item); SPAR / DUNGEON /
## CRAFT are generic action counters (any duel / dungeon clear / craft). Fixed
## amount + reward, no per-level scaling — author a separate template at a higher
## min_level for a tougher version. Keeps numbers readable.

enum Kind { KILL, COLLECT, SPAR, DUNGEON, CRAFT }

## Stable id used to track progress on a player. Two templates must never share
## an id; rolling a duplicate would silently overwrite progress in the player's
## stored daily set.
@export var template_id: int = 0
@export var kind: Kind = Kind.KILL
## KILL: enemy_type to match (&"goblin", &"slime", etc.).
## COLLECT: target item to count in inventory.
@export var enemy_type: StringName
@export var item: Item
@export var required_amount: int = 1

## Eligibility window — a player whose level falls in [min_level, max_level]
## can be assigned this. 0 max = no cap.
@export var min_level: int = 0
@export var max_level: int = 0

## Lifetime "adventure xp" only — it fills the HUD bar and levels NOTHING, since
## character level is derived from masteries. [member reward_mastery_xp] is the
## number that actually moves a character forward.
@export var reward_xp: int = 10
## Weapon-mastery XP paid on claim into the category of the weapon in HAND (empty
## hands fall back to the player's best mastery — RewardService.grant_mastery_reward).
## Scale it against KILLS: an ordinary mob pays its effective HP × 4, so a woodland
## goblin is worth ~1,100 and a fungus sporeling ~4,000. A daily should read as an
## afternoon's hunting, not a rounding error.
@export var reward_mastery_xp: int = 0
@export var reward_gold: int = 3

## Friendly text for the UI. Auto-generated from kind/target if empty.
@export var description: String
## Where to do this, in words ("Fungus Cave", "Mining Cave · Overworld"). Shown on
## the board card under the objective. Same idea as SlayerTaskDef.location_hint and
## for the same reason: a board that says "Defeat 1 Iron Golem" and nothing else is
## unactionable to a player who has never found one. Empty = no hint line (the
## generic SPAR / DUNGEON / CRAFT kinds don't need one).
