extends Resource
## Editor-authored quest, registered as the "quests" content type (same workflow as
## shops/recipes): create instances in a data folder, run the TinyMMO plugin's Generate
## for content_name "quests", and each quest gets a registry id/slug baked into metadata
## so it resolves through ContentRegistryHub and travels over the network as a small id.

## How many objectives must be completed for the quest to be turnable.
## ALL = every objective; ANY = a single objective is enough (used for "pick one
## NPC to introduce yourself to"-style quests where the player chooses a path).
enum Completion { ALL, ANY }

## How many of [member requires_quests] must be turned in before this quest is
## available. ALL = classic chain link; ANY = "finish one of several paths".
enum RequiresMode { ALL, ANY }

@export var quest_name: String

## Steps to complete, in display order.

## no walk-back-to-the-giver step. Reserved for "self-evident" quests like the
## welcome tour where forcing a return trip is just friction.

@export_group("Availability")
## Player level required to see this quest at the giver. 0 = no level requirement.
## Used by the milestone notification system: when a player levels up to N, any
## quest with min_level == N triggers an unlock notification.
@export var min_level: int = 0
## Profession skill gate, ANDed on top of min_level: the job slug the player
## has to have leveled (&"mining", &"woodcutting", ... — see JobRegistry).
## Empty = no skill requirement. Use this instead of min_level for gathering
## and crafting quests, where "can you do the work" is a skill question, not a
## combat-level one. Skill gates are NOT part of the milestone notification
## system (that buckets by min_level only), so a skill-gated quest's
## unlock_message never fires on a skill level-up.
@export var min_skill: StringName
## Level the [member min_skill] skill must reach. Ignored when min_skill is empty.
@export var min_skill_level: int = 0
## Optional system-channel message pushed to the player the moment the quest
## becomes ACCEPTABLE (all gates open: min_level reached AND prerequisites
## satisfied — see LevelMilestoneService), styled to look like it's from the
## relevant NPC. Empty = no notification (the quest just becomes available
## silently). Include the NPC name in brackets at the start of the text so it
## reads like a personal message in chat, e.g.
##   "[Duel Master] I've heard you've been honing your blade. Find me at the arena."
@export_multiline var unlock_message: String
## Prior quests gating this one (drag in their QuestResources). Empty = no quest
## prerequisite. Unmet prerequisites show the quest LOCKED at its giver (name +
## unlock conditions, no Accept — owner call 2026-07-04 after playtest; hiding
## made chain pops invisible) and hard-block accept server-side. min_level is
## always a separate AND on top, so "completed X AND reached level N" is both
## fields together.
@export var requires_quests: Array[QuestResource]
## ALL = every quest in requires_quests must be turned in; ANY = one is enough.
@export var requires_mode: RequiresMode = RequiresMode.ALL
## Character flag that must be set on the player (PlayerResource.character_flags),
## ANDed on top of requires_quests + min_level. This is the seam the v1 wardstone
## key-gate plugs into — nothing sets flags yet. Empty = no flag requirement.
@export var requires_flag: StringName

@export_group("Delivery")
## If set, only THIS NPC turns the quest in (drag in its NPCResource). For delivery
## quests: NPC A offers it, NPC B accepts the turn-in. Leave EMPTY (default) when the
## same NPC that offers it also turns it in (the runtime resolves to the offerer).
@export var turn_in_giver: NPCResource
## Filename slug of the turn-in NPC (e.g. &"hall_keeper") used when
## [member turn_in_giver] is empty. Same cycle-avoidance as QuestObjective.target_giver_key.
@export var turn_in_giver_slug: StringName = &""
## Optional item granted to the player when they accept the quest (a sealed
## letter, a parcel, etc.). The item is consumed on turn-in. Use sparingly:
## quest items have no vendor utility and just clutter the bag.
@export var grant_on_accept: Item

@export_group("Rewards")
## Lifetime "adventure xp" only (PlayerResource.experience) — it fills the HUD bar
## and levels NOTHING, because character level is derived from masteries. Use
## [member reward_mastery_xp] for the reward that actually progresses a character.
@export var reward_xp: int
## Weapon-mastery XP paid at turn-in into the category of the weapon in HAND
## (empty hands fall back to the player's best mastery — see
## RewardService.grant_mastery_reward). This is the number that moves a character
## forward, so scale it against KILLS, not against reward_xp: an ordinary mob pays
## its effective HP × 4 (EnemyTypeResource.combat_skill_xp_for), which puts a
## woodland goblin near 1,100 and a fungus sporeling near 4,000. A quest worth
## ~10-20 of its own targets reads as a real chapter reward.
@export var reward_mastery_xp: int
@export var reward_gold: int
@export var reward_items: Array[QuestReward]
## Vanity title granted on turn-in. Empty = no title. Added to the player's
## titles_unlocked list; auto-equipped if no other title is active.
@export var grant_title: String
## Wardstone granted when this quest's climax OBJECTIVE completes (dungeon
## cleared / boss slain) — NOT at turn-in, so the unlock lands on the triumph
## (docs/wardstones.md). Empty = none. Only a biome chain's finale quest sets
## this; the slug is the biome's (e.g. &"woodland").
@export var grants_wardstone: StringName = &""
## Character flag set on turn-in (PlayerResource.character_flags). Used to
## swap story NPCs (e.g. Lira bound → freed) and gate later quests via
