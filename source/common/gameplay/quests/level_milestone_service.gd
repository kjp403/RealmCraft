class_name LevelMilestoneService
## Fires a quest's unlock_message (a styled chat note "from" the giving NPC)
## at the moment the quest becomes ACCEPTABLE — i.e. when its LAST gate opens.
## Two gates exist (QuestResource.min_level + prerequisites_met), so there are
## two firing paths, partitioned so a single event never toasts twice:
##
## - on_levels_gained  — the level-up was the last gate (prereqs already met).
## - on_quest_turned_in — the prereq turn-in was the last gate (level already
##   met BEFORE this turn-in; level-ups granted BY the turn-in belong to the
##   on_levels_gained call that follows it in apply_turn_in).
##
## Empty unlock_message = no notification (the quest just appears silently at
## its giver). Cached on first use so we don't walk the quests registry every
## kill.

## Called when a player turns in [param quest_id] (see QuestService.apply_turn_in).
## Fires unlock messages for quests that listed it as a prerequisite and are now
## fully available. [param old_level] is the player's level BEFORE the turn-in's
## XP: quests whose min_level sits above it are left to on_levels_gained (they
## unlock via the level, not the prereq), which is what makes the two paths
## mutually exclusive. An ANY-mode quest with several paths and an
## unlock_message may toast once per path completed until accepted — rare
## authoring shape, accepted.
